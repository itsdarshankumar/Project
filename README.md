# Project
This is the repository for our submission for the GLOBAL GAME JAM 2022

## About
Our aim was to create some popular Casino/Arcade games and make them interactive and user-friendly  
We came up with three games:  
- Slot Machine  
- Blackjack  
- Spin the Wheel  
All three games were built on the system of credits as the currency for betting, and  
we tried to make it so that the credits were outsourced to the local storage itself
This project is in incubation mode right now, many changes will be made with time for it  
to be evolved into a better game. 

### 1. Slot Machine  
We made a simple and lightweight Slot Machine Program using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript  
This game has the feature of borrowing credits from the kocal storage

###  2. Blackjack
This Blackjack program was also built using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.  
We tried to make this program as sser-friendly and interactive as possible  

### 3. Spin the Wheel
This is just the classic casino modelled Spin the Wheel  
This game is also built on vanilla HTML5, CSS and JavaScript
