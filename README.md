# Project
This is the repository for our submission for the GLOBAL GAME JAM 2022

## About
  Our aim was to create some popular Casino/Arcade games and make them interactive and user-friendly  
  We came up with three games:  
- Slot Machine  
- Blackjack  
- Spin the Wheel   
- All three games were built on the system of credits as the currency for betting  
  
  This project is in incubation mode right now, many changes will be made with time for it  
  to be evolved into a better and complete game.  

  ### 1. Slot Machine  
  We made a simple and lightweight Slot Machine Program using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript  


  ###  2. Blackjack
  This Blackjack program was also built using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.  
  We tried to make this program as sser-friendly and interactive as possible  

  ### 3. Spin the Wheel
  This is just the classic casino modelled Spin the Wheel  
  This game is also built on vanilla HTML5, CSS and JavaScript
